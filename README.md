# From-Scratch Linear Regression

This project implements a simple Linear Regression model from scratch using Python and NumPy. It serves as an educational tool to understand the inner workings of linear regression without relying on high-level libraries like scikit-learn.

## üìå Features

- **Custom Implementation**: Builds the Linear Regression model using NumPy for matrix operations.
- **Bias Term Handling**: Automatically adds an intercept term to the feature matrix.
- **Prediction Capability**: Provides a method to predict outcomes on new data.
- **Educational Focus**: Designed to help learners grasp the fundamentals of linear regression.
